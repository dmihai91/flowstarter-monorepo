/**
 * Static guard: every `.from(<tenant table>)` call in this worker's `src/`
 * must either carry `.eq('workspace_id', ...)` in the same statement, or go
 * through `withTenant(...)` (see `src/tenancy.ts`).
 *
 * This worker's Supabase client authenticates with the service role and
 * bypasses RLS (see the module doc on `src/job-store.ts`), so the only thing
 * standing between one workspace's query and another workspace's row is
 * remembering to filter by hand at every call site. This test is the
 * backstop for that: it reads every `.ts` source file under `src/`
 * (excluding tests and `tenancy.ts` itself), finds every `.from('table')`
 * call on a table known to carry a `workspace_id` column, and asserts the
 * enclosing statement is filtered. A call site this can't account for fails
 * with the offending file and table.
 *
 * A handful of call sites in `job-store.ts` are legitimately not filtered by
 * `workspace_id` -- see `ALLOW_LIST` below, each with a comment explaining
 * why. Everything else must be filtered or go through `withTenant`.
 *
 * Note on location: the Phase 0 spec named this file
 * `src/__tests__/worker-tenant-filter.test.ts`, but this package's
 * `vitest.config.ts` only collects `test/**\/*.test.ts` (matching every
 * other test here) -- a file under `src/__tests__` would silently never
 * run. It lives at `test/worker-tenant-filter.test.ts` instead so it
 * actually executes.
