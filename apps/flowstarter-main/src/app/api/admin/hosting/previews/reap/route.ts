/**
 * POST /api/admin/hosting/previews/reap — tear down expired funnel previews.
 *
 * The reaper is meant to run on a schedule (`PREVIEW_REAP` in the job ledger).
 * This is the operator's hand on the same lever: when previews are piling up on
 * a host, or a sweep needs to be forced before a maintenance window, an
 * operator can run it and see exactly what came down.
 *
 * Team-only. Reaping is destructive to a hosted site, and the previews it
 * touches belong to visitors who have no account and cannot be asked.
 *
 * GET is the same query without the teardown: what WOULD be reaped right now.
