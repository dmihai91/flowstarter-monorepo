/**
 * POST /api/client/site/[workspaceId]/publish: mark the current version as
 * the one that should go live, and start the build that puts it there.
 *
 * WHY THIS ENQUEUES INSTEAD OF DEPLOYING. `deploySite` takes a built artifact,
 * a tarball or an HTTPS URL, and hands it to the per-host deploy agent, which
 * extracts it under /var/www/sites and reloads Caddy. What an editor produces
 * is an edited *source* manifest: Astro components and content files. Pushing
 * those to the agent would publish source, not a site, and pushing the last
 * build's `preview_artifact_url` instead would publish the client's site
 * without the change they just made and report success. So the missing piece
 * was never a deploy call here, it was a build of the edited manifest.
 *
 * That build is a SITE_REBUILD job. The version is stamped `published_at`, and
 * a job is queued and the worker is nudged; the worker materializes the same
 * manifest column a full build reads, validates it, commits, and deploys the
 * build output. A rebuild already `running` has frozen the manifest it will
 * build, so it cannot pick up this publish's edit: `enqueueSiteRebuild` joins
 * a `queued` job if one is waiting, otherwise starts a new one behind a
 * partial unique index that allows at most one `queued` SITE_REBUILD per
 * workspace, so at most one job ever waits behind whatever is running. The
 * response names what actually happened, including the two cases where no
 * build is started: a project with no server allocated yet, and an environment
 * with no deploy agent configured, where a build would have nowhere to go.
