/**
 * The seam between the anonymous funnel and an owned project.
 *
 * The discovery wizard generates a real, personalized preview against a
 * throwaway `demoId`: no workspace, no membership, no artifacts. The deposit
 * half of the product expects the opposite — a workspace the caller is a
 * member of, in PREVIEW_READY, with a quote and an artifacts row for the build
 * worker to build from. Nothing converted one into the other, so the two
 * halves could never meet.
 *
 * Claiming is that conversion. It runs once per preview and is safe to retry:
 * `workspaces.claimed_preview_id` carries a partial unique index, so a double
 * submit (or a browser retry after a slow response) converges on the same
 * workspace instead of minting a second one.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately server-owned here and are never read from the
 * request body:
 *   - the preview manifest, brand config and template — captured by the
 *     generation pipeline itself (`rememberClaimablePreview`), because the
 *     browser never sees them and must not be able to dictate what gets built;
 *   - the money. The wizard sends a tier *name*; the euro figure comes from
 *     the same published price table the pricing page quotes.
