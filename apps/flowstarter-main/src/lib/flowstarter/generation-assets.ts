/**
 * The only supported way to load a workspace's assets for generation.
 *
 * Rights are confirmed over a specific set of files at selection time, so an
 * asset row existing says we hold the file, not that we may publish it. Every
 * other reader in the app answers "what does this workspace have" -- the gate
 * deliberately counts unconfirmed uploads, because they still tell us what is
 * missing. This one answers "what may we build with", which is a different
 * question and the only one the generator is allowed to ask.
 *
 * It lives apart from those readers so the filter cannot be lost by editing a
 * shared query, and a guard test fails the build if the preview route or the
 * worker assembles generator assets from a raw table read instead.
