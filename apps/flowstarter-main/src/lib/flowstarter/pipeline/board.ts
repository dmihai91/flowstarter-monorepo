/**
 * Turning raw rows into the operator's pipeline board.

 * The board answers one question: which projects are stuck? Everything here is
 * pure so that question is testable without a database — the API layer does the
 * three queries and hands the rows in.
 *
 * "Stuck" is two different failures wearing the same face:
 *   - a job that nobody is running (queued past its dispatch window, or failed),
 *     which is the documented outcome of a Stripe webhook whose worker dispatch
 *     threw and was swallowed; and
 *   - a project that no job is even trying to move, sitting in one state past
 *     the point where a human should have touched it.
 * Both surface as `stalled` with a reason string an operator can act on.
