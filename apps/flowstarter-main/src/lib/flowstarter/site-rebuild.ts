/**
 * Enqueueing the build that turns a published edit into a live site.
 *
 * The editor saves an edited *source* manifest, and a source manifest is not
 * something a deploy agent can serve. So publishing does not deploy, it asks
 * for a build: one SITE_REBUILD row in the ledger, which the build worker
 * claims, validates, commits and hands to the same publisher a full build
 * uses. This module owns the enqueue and nothing else, so the route stays a
 * route and the "join or start a new one" rule lives in one place.
 *
 * The worker freezes the manifest it will build at claim time (see
 * job-store.ts claim()), so a `running` job is already building whatever
 * manifest existed when it was claimed. A publish that lands after that can
 * only join a `queued` job, because a queued job's manifest is read fresh
 * when the worker later claims it; joining a `running` job would silently
 * lose the edit. So: join a `queued` job if one exists, otherwise start a new
 * one, even if a `running` job is already in flight for this workspace. At
 * most one job may be queued per workspace at a time, enforced by a partial
 * unique index in the database, not by the read below: two publishes a few
 * milliseconds apart would both read "none queued", and the index is what
 * decides which of them gets the row. The read is only there so the common
 * case does not spend an insert to learn it.
