/**
 * Teardown for expired funnel previews.
 *
 * Every preview is a real hosted site with a real TLS certificate and a real
 * disk footprint on a shared box. Without this, generating one is a permanent
 * commitment: a visitor who never comes back leaves us serving their business's
 * name and our copy, forever, at a URL we can no longer account for. The TTL on
 * `funnel_previews.expires_at` is the promise; this is what keeps it.
 *
 * Two things it will not do, ever:
 *
 *  - touch a CLAIMED preview. `listExpiredFunnelPreviews` filters on
 *    `claimed_workspace_id is null` and this re-checks each row before acting,
 *    because the claim and the sweep can race: a preview claimed a millisecond
 *    after the query would otherwise have its site removed out from under the
 *    client who just paid attention to it.
 *  - delete anything under `tenant/`. The only object it removes is the funnel
 *    copy at `funnel/{previewId}/site.tar.gz`;
 *    `deleteFunnelPreviewArtifact` refuses any other prefix. A claimed
 *    preview's artifact was copied under the client's workspace and belongs to
 *    them.
 *
 * Failure is per-row and non-fatal: one preview whose agent call fails must not
 * stop the other forty from being reclaimed. Failures are counted and returned
 * so an operator sees them.
