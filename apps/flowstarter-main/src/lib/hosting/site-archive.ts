/**
 * Turning a generated manifest into something the deploy-agent can extract.
 *
 * The agent's contract is a gzipped tarball it fetches over HTTPS (or receives
 * as raw bytes), extracts into a staging dir, and renames into place.
 * Everything upstream of it (the funnel pipeline, the build worker) speaks in
 * `{path, content}` files, so this is the seam that converts one into the
 * other.
 *
 * The tar writer itself lives in `@flowstarter/agentic-codegen` because the
 * build worker packs the same archives from outside this app and the two must
 * emit identical bytes. What stays here is the policy this app owns: NO-INDEX.
 *
 * NO-INDEX is applied at packaging time rather than left to the web server
 * alone. A preview is a real, publicly reachable site carrying a real
 * business's name and copy we generated for them; it must never end up in a
 * search index and outrank the site they eventually pay for. The Caddy snippet
 * sets `X-Robots-Tag`, and this sets the `<meta name="robots">` — two
 * independent mechanisms, because a header is lost the moment somebody saves
 * or re-serves the file and a meta tag is lost the moment a crawler only reads
 * headers.
