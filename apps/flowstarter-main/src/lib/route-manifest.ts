/**
 * The route lists `middleware.ts` matches on, kept in their own module so a
 * test can read them without booting Clerk, Arcjet and the Edge runtime.
 *
 * `src/__tests__/route-manifest.test.ts` checks every page entry here against
 * the pages that actually exist under `src/app`, so an entry whose page is
 * deleted, renamed or never written fails the unit suite. That check is why
 * eleven paths were removed from `PUBLIC_ROUTES` on 2026-09-09: `/gdpr`,
 * `/guides`, `/blogs`, `/sitemap`, `/accessibility`, `/cookie-policy`,
 * `/term-of-service`, `/privacy-policy`, `/forgot-password`,
 * `/reset-password` and `/verify` had no page behind them and nothing in the
 * app linked to them. The password reset and email verification flows are not
 * separate pages: they are steps inside the Clerk `useSignIn` state machine in
 * `packages/flow-design-system/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`, rendered on
 * `/login`.
 *
 * Every entry uses Clerk's `createRouteMatcher` syntax, so `(.*)` means "this
 * path and everything under it".

/**
 * Reachable without a Clerk session. The middleware decides auth from this

 * whether the shell may paint before Clerk finishes loading, and the two
 * drifting apart is what once left `/unlock` behind a permanent loader.
