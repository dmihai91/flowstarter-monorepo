/**
 * Appends a version query to a static asset path so a content change forces a
 * fresh fetch through Cloudflare (which caches /showcase/*.png and the
 * /_next/image optimized variants with a long s-maxage, keyed on the URL).
 *
 * Cloudflare's cache key includes the query string, so bumping ASSET_VERSION
 * changes the key for every versioned asset and the edge refetches from the
 * Netlify origin. Netlify serves the file ignoring the query, so the param is
 * purely a cache-busting token. Bump ASSET_VERSION whenever showcase
 * thumbnails (or other versioned static assets) are regenerated.
