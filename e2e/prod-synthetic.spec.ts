 * Tier 4: production synthetic, run after every deploy.
 *
 * Runs only in the `prod-synthetic` Playwright project, which only exists
 * when PROD_SYNTHETIC=1 (see playwright.config.ts), against
 * PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL, default https://flowstarter.net. The lane that runs it
 * is .depot/workflows/prod-synthetic.yml.
 *
 * This one is blocking by design. It reads production and writes nothing:
 * no account, no lead, no canary row, no deposit. The only POST it makes is
 * an unsigned Stripe webhook, which the route is required to reject before it
 * touches anything.
 *
 * Where it differs from the per-pull-request contract spec
 * (e2e/contract.spec.ts): the contract spec tolerates an unreachable database
 * because a keyless Deploy Preview is not given one. Production is, so the
 * health check here is a hard 200.
